## Animals

This subsection contains a list of "animals".
(The plus signs are there to make things slightly easier for you. After all, it's fairly hard to distinguish animals from other words using only regexes)

+ Dangernoodle, a natural enemy of the Booplesnoot
+ Majestic Sea Flap-Flap
+ Dangerous Sea Flap-Flap
+ Trash Panda
+ Fart Squirrel (not as undangerous as it sounds)
+ Danger Floof - not to be confused with the Danger Water Cow
+ Nope Rope
+ Sword Pig (not as dangerous as it sounds)
+ Bacon Puppy
+ Dapper Chickens
+ and finally Strangerdanger which could be a name for a dog.

### This is a subsubsection

* It contains
* Some list elements
* Such as this one

### Code

Here's some code that can be searched.  
This is a bit harder, since the exercises corresponding to it, require regexes that span over multiple lines.

```java

class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Out o = new Out();
		o.out();
	}
}

class Out {
	public void out() {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```
